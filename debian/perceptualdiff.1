.SH NAME
perceptualdiff \- compare images using a perceptually based image metric
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B perceptualdiff
.RI " <image1> <image2> " [ options ]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B perceptualdiff
command.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
\fBperceptualdiff\fP is a program that compares image1.tif and 
image2.tif using a perceptually based image metric. Note: Input 
files can also be in the PNG format
.SH OPTIONS
A summary of options is included below.
.TP
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
: Turns on verbose mode
.TP
\fB\-\-fov\fR deg
: Field of view in degrees (0.1 to 89.9)
.TP
\fB\-\-threshold\fR p
: #pixels p below which differences are ignored
.TP
\fB\-\-gamma\fR g
: Value to convert rgb into linear space (default 2.2)
.TP
\fB\-\-luminance\fR l
: White luminance (default 100.0 cdm^\-2)
.HP
\fB\-\-luminanceonly\fR : Only consider luminance; ignore chroma (color) in the comparison
.TP
\fB\-\-colorfactor\fR
: How much of color to use, 0.0 to 1.0, 0.0 = ignore color.
.TP
